            I took an unconventional path into techâ€”I didn't start programming
            until after college. My background is in Psychology and Political
            Science, and for a while, I thought I'd become a lawyer.
            <br />
            ____
            <br />
            That is, until I started prepping for law school.
            <br />
            ____
            <br />
            The endless studying and courtroom negotiations didn't excite me the
            way I'd hoped. I wanted something hands-on, something where I could
            think critically, solve complex problems, and build solutions that
            made an impact. That's when I discovered coding, and I dove in
            headfirst. I started with general programming, building projects
            like a weather app and this website, but I found myself drawn to
            cybersecurity.
            <br />
            ____
            <br />
            Now, I'm focused on securing systems and analyzing vulnerabilities.
            I've been developing my skills in Python, network security, and
            threat analysis, and I'm eager to apply them to real-world security
            challenges. I'm looking for a role where I can help protect
            organizations and strengthen their defenses.
