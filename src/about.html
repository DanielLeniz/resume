                I completed my Bachelor's in Psychology from the University of South Florida. I am self-taught in
                various languages, such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python, as well as technologies 
                including AWS and Terraform. I have also implemented end-to-end testing to ensure proper
                website functionality and user experience, while deploying serverless functions to
                run this website in the cloud. I am ready to find my place in full stack development
                with a dedicated team while building projects that I love.
                I am interested in full stack so that I can experience more aspects of the development
                process, including accessibility and design, infrastructure, and databases and APIs, which will help
                grow my skill set in various ways. By understanding the full picture, I am better able to comprehend 
                the integration between front and backend.

                In my free time, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, and baking. If I don't have the energy for any of those,
                I solve a crossword puzzle or two.
