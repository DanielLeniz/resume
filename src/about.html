                    So, I was late to the game - I didn't start programming until after college.
                    I got a degree in Psychology and Political Science with dreams of becoming a lawyer.

                    That is, until I tried prepping for law school.

                    The endless studying and thoughts of negotiations and days in the courtroom just didn't light my fire anymore. I craved something more hands on, something where I could actually build things.
                    I was introduced to coding and dove in head first. I scoured the internet for countless resources from
                    YouTube and Stack OverFlow to Harvard University's CS50x course. I wanted to solve puzzles and learn how to create effective solutions.
                    I started off simple with a weather app, then moved onto building a social media app. Recently, I finished enhancing a single page
                    web scraper for LinkedIn profiles, for a <span style='font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'>real</span> company.

                    I've been honing my skills, focusing mainly on JavaScript and Python. I am seeking a full-time role where I can help a company achieve their goals.
